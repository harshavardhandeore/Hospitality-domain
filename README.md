# Hospitality-domain (Interactive dashboard using Power BI)

## Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to provide insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as RevPar, ADR, realization, cancellations, weekly trends, and occupancy for AtliQ Hotels. By analyzing these metrics, we aim to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize hotel 

## Datasets

-[bookings](https://github.com/harshavardhandeore/Hospitality-domain/blob/main/fact_bookings.csv)

## Questions (KPIs)
This analysis aims to answer the following key questions (KPIs):
- What is the revenue distribution between business and leisure hotels?
- How does revenue vary across different booking platforms?
- What are the trends in RevPar (Revenue per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), realization, cancellations, and occupancy rates over time?
- How do individual properties perform in terms of revenue, occupancy, and customer ratings?
- Which cities generate the highest and lowest revenue for AtliQ Hotels?
- What is the impact of seasonality on occupancy rates and revenue?
- How do customer ratings correlate with hotel revenue and occupancy rates?

## Process
The analysis was conducted using Power BI, following these steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** The necessary datasets were imported into Power BI and relationships were established to create a star schema.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Data cleaning and transformations were performed to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Metrics Creation:** Key metrics such as RevPar, ADR, realization, cancellations, and occupancy rates were created based on the customer's requirements.
4. **Dashboard Creation:** A comprehensive Power BI dashboard was designed and developed to visualize the key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights, including filters for dynamic analysis.

The final dashboard provides a detailed overview of the performance metrics, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.
